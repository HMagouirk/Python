This file was created in March of 2024 for a Kaggle project. While one would like for the survival rate of Titanic passengers
to be 100%, we all know that isn't the case. According to history, 32% of the passengers survived the tragedy.
This project utilizes Python to train a random tree classifier model to predict the probability of survival for 
individual Titanic passengers. You can consult Kaggle submissions for this category to compare scripts and results.
Updates since creation have been for a name change and to categorize this project into a folder to aid in organization.
